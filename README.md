DSA note plus models  

🧠 **METHOD TO SOLVE A PROBLEM**  
### **Put Timer**
### **Understand Clearly**  
- Read problem twice  
- Identify input/output  
- Ask: Can input be empty? Negative? Huge?  

### **Brute Force First**  
- Always think of brute-force. Helps in:  
  - Understanding constraints  
  - Estimating time complexity  

### **Optimize Step-by-Step**  
- Apply pattern (e.g., Two Pointers → Sliding Window)  
- Think space/time trade-offs  

### **Dry Run on Sample Input**  
- Do a dry run on paper for complex logic  
- Use real test cases  

### **Code Neatly**  
- Clean code, meaningful variable names, modular functions  

### **Test Edge Cases**  
- Empty array, duplicates, large input, all equal values, etc.

✍️ **NOTE-MAKING STRATEGY**  

### 📒 **Pattern-Based Notes**  
- Maintain a separate section for each pattern:  
  - "Sliding Window", "DP", "Greedy", etc.  
- For each pattern, write:  
  - Definition  
  - When to use  
  - 3–5 core problems + solution links/snippets  

### 📌 **Problem Insight Notes**  
- Only for tricky or new concepts  
- Write:  
  - Core idea / "aha!" moment  
  - What mistake you made  
  - Your brute-force and optimized approach  

### ⚙️ **Mistake Log**  
- Track common bugs:  
  - Off-by-one, wrong loop condition, overflow, etc.
